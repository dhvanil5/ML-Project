🏏 IPL Win Probability Predictor
Predict the Match. Own the Game.

A machine learning-powered project to calculate real-time win probability during IPL matches based on dynamic in-game data.

📌 Overview
This project leverages historical IPL data and machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of a team winning a match at any given point. By inputting live match stats such as runs, overs, and wickets, the model estimates win probabilities for both batting and bowling teams.

🎯 Objectives
Build a predictive model using past IPL match data

Calculate win probability using real-time match context

Deploy via an intuitive interface (e.g., Streamlit)

Visualize insights that help users understand match momentum

🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Modeling: Classification (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Deployment: Streamlit / Flask (optional)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

🧠 How the Model Works
Data Collection & Cleaning – Historical IPL ball-by-ball data is cleaned and formatted

Feature Engineering – Derived features such as current run rate, required run rate, wickets in hand, overs left, etc.

Model Training – Classification models predict match outcomes based on current match context

Probability Output – Outputs a percentage win prediction for each team

Deployment (Optional) – Real-time inputs through a web interface for live prediction

📊 Sample Input & Output
